<!-- This is just a test file for an object ID to name/variable mapping format. This
  list could actually be in config or in a seperate directory or something.  When the
  system starts, this file would be read in and variables added to the global_env which
  map to the object IDs in this file.  Everything (including internal stuff) could look
  up these variables for things like which object should user objects inherit from. -->
