- futuristic but not traditional sci-fi (no aliens, no faster than light travel, probably no more space advancement than current)
- transhumans/cyborgs/mezodes possibly
- unless it's apocalyptic, there will still be a sizable population and a reasonable enough advancement to go with it
- global community in shambles with large areas of earth in semi isolation.  Basically things aren't like they are now with a world
  community where large portions of the population are connected.  There is no guaranteed security they way there is now, with large
  powerful militaries at peace with eachother, and ensuring no attacks take place on their soil.  Communities are weaker and thus more
  insular in the interest of protection.  There are larger portions of the population of earth that are at a disadvantage and are
  opportunistic as a result.
- a global crisis has occurred (massive food shortage/crop failures/energy crisis/etc) which causes such chaos, possibly along with a
  financial meltdown in the west, causes the whole way of life to fracture (the population bubble bursts and there is no longer a
  surplus of energy and resources to support everybody, especially people in the west)

- Corporate Serfdoms: The remains of areas of the west.  Fair amount of resources but not enough to defend large areas or to gang up
  into a country.  Run by corporations.  Major cities would survive (as long as they could get food and power somehow) (at least some
  would survive).  They would be safe but people would not have many rights.  They would have the technology to maintain a lot of
  current advancements but not able to really develop much.  Many things would not be possible due to lack of resources (simply too
  expensive).

- Barbaric Despots: small city states or kingdoms ruled by dictators who are somehow able to support a small group of people with their
  resources and protect their people from outside attacks (when possible) but in exchange they govern strictly

- vast areas of wasteland where no rule of law exists.  There would be lots of small walled communities/villages where people would try
  to subside on simple farming.  Each would be independantly governed (with possibly wildly differing laws) and self-defended for the
  most part (possibly alliances between villages to help defend eachother.  Inbetween would be varying levels of bandit activity, preying
  on transportation between secured villages and cities and so on.

- Old guard scientist transhumans that are hidden away (your typical "Community" daydream) Possibly revealed shortly before the total
  meltdown such that a group of refugees tries to gain access to their hidden town(s) but are turned away and helped to settle nearby,
  living a peaceful, probably/possibly agrarian society.  This group has near unlimited resources, but never appears and is mythical if
  even known by anyone...

- there are plenty of unsecure areas of the world where you could find out what a lawless area with bandits would be like, such as
