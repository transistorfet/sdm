* it might be possible to repurpose this system as the core of a home automation network (i've been thinking about this for a while)
* The main advantages are that you can change and test things easily on the fly and have those changes saved to disc, and possibly
  revision controlled as well.  Larger changes would be harder to do but still possible.
* the IRC interface might still be useful but most things would be done through a basic command prompt (telnet?) type system, or by
  some other means

* there would need to be some adjustment to the task and output distribution system.  Instead of having a user in the way we do now,
  the 'user' would be any object that represents the initiator of the action (i guess it would always be the owner of the currently
  executing task).

* I envision each device in the network being represented by an object.  The RGB controlled would be represented by an object, and there
  would be a task that communicates with the device itself.  If you want to control the device, you call a method on the object, which
  would send a message to the device and get confirmation if needed and all that.  It could possibly even cause the calling task to
  block until confirmation is received (subject to a timeout).  When IR data comes in from the controlled, it can use information in
  the object itself to direct the data as needed, calling an appropriate method on another object that registered itself for that data,
  for example.

* you could 'go/teleport' to that object to work on it locally (it will be checked for matching methods when you execute a command)
