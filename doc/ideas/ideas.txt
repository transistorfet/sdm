- The Jabberwock!  You could have the jabberwock as the supreme beast of the realm which is so invincible that
  it can only be killed with the Vorpal Blade (which has as a description something like "It looks like it
  goes snicker-snack").  The jabberwock should be very hard to find and *perhaps* it randomly appears (but only
  in certain areas) and destroys everything.  Perhaps it should generally only do that to places without
  players because it would suck getting randomly killed.  The vorpal blade would also be very hard to find.
  It would only be wieldable and even pickupable by players of sufficient level and would have something like
  +1,000,000 damage to the jabberwock (or to some special class of monster).  There would only be one such
  blade and anyone carrying it will have a special description so that other players know who posesses it.
  Any player that posesses it must have PvP enabled (if it can even be disabled) so that people can fight
  for it.  The blade should therefore only be marginally better than the best weapon when used against
  players (to give people a chance).

- you could have a clearing or something with a white rabbit that if you follow the rabbit, it takes you to
  a room that you can't get into any other way that leads down the rabbit hole into wonderland.  In order to
  get out, (if this is possible) you can "wake up" and you will be teleported back to the clearing where it
  will announce something like "$name, who you didn't notice sleeping in the tree, wakes up here."

- hp, mana, and movement points (fatigue?)

- the great hall can be called "The Banquet Hall of Gobbles The Great".  Gobbles can be a god most likely
- Perhaps you start in the entrance hall, outside the entrance to the great hall in the clouds.  The whole
  things is surrounded by clouds with a beanstock or something poking through the clouds from below that you
  can't see the bottom of (at the base of the great hall).  The entrance has a cloak room and mabye some other
  things and then you go into the banquet hall of gobbles the great with rooms off to the sides (the hall
  itself could be 3 rooms long).  (What is the cloak room for?)

- List of monsters, might come in handy =)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Monsters

- have a tutorial map area that everybody is put on when they first register (eventually) and maybe after
  completing it, you get put in a different place depending on your character perhaps

- you could have a special orb that if you gaze into it, you find yourself transported to an "other realms"
  area or back to the world where you were.  This other realms area would also me a heaven sort of place
  where you'd go when you die.  You would probably go to another area though.  It would not be difficult to
  store the last place you were in each area (world or other realms) as a property either in the orb or in
  the player depending on how the orb works (can it be given to other players and thus if other players can
  go where you were last).
- this other realms place could have a grand hall plus lots of other areas
- there could be a morgue where you can go to get your body.  Perhaps when you die, your body's location and
  such is recorded as to where it is.  You can either go back to the world and get it (with all your items)
  or you can purchase it at the morgue which only then will cause your corpse in the world to "vanish" (or
  have a mobile pop out of nowhere, pick it up, and vanish) and it will be given to you.
- the other realms could have some kind of special provision against killing somehow so that you can't die
- if you wanted to have a social and mud at the same time, you could optionally sign up for only a social
  account and when you want to play, you go to a special "soul assignment" room or something with a person
  that assigns you to a body (turns your account into a character and inserts you in the world)

- gold/coins/money can be represented as a bag of money object such that you can loose your bag and thus your
  money but you don't need an object for each piece of gold.  The object could be special such that if you
  pick up someone else's bag, it deletes it and adds it's contents to the bag you have.  This might be
  difficult for buying items since the buyer would have to search all your items for a money bag to take
  your gold out of unless you want to make a system where you have to type a command to give gold in which
  case, the receiver has an opportunity to not give you the item in return (or vise versa) as a form of
  stealing

- a secret area that is like a mini town/secret layer for a secret cult society place populated mostly by
  mobiles and the only way to get in is by abandoning certain rights or privillages and if you violate them,
  the npcs will kill you or something.  Basically it's a crazy cult that is hard to infultrate

- societies (secret societies)
- a world inside of an orb (special orb object that teleports you when you
  examine it)
- should there be game areas and non-game (social only) areas?  You could have a flag on rooms such that
  certain mobiles/npcs can't enter, and fighting is not allowed
- should there be multiple games/world in the same server or just have
  multiple server processes that are completely seperate?
- a special map teleporter object? you can record certain locations and by
  activating them, you travel to that location (either by making you travel or
  via teleportation)

- you could have the scene with the bridgekeeper as a guard to something and you have to answer the bridge
  keepers questions where the first 2 are always the person's name and quest while the last is randomly
  selected from an expanded list of obscure questions most of which are hard but occationally you'll get the
  easy, favorite colour question and sometimes you'll get the airspeed velocity question which if you answer
  with the proper response question, the bridgekeeper is thrown into the gorge of eternal peril instead and
  then anyone can pass without being tested (but after a certain time, he's regenerated).
