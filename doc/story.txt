The central area is a huge inlet that opens to the ocean to the west.  To the north is mostly mountains and
fjord type terrain and on the south side of the inlet is more marshy lowlands.  There is a smaller inlet that
opens to the north and closes up to a river in a valley that meanders through the mountains and ends up in
a very large narrow valley lake.
