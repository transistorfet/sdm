Visual text mud idea!

Text has the ability to convey meaning without unnecessary detail unlike graphics which have to have a certain amount of detail and style
to even resemble what some element is supposed to be.  Graphics on the other hand can be understood very quickly unlike text which must
be read first.  So why not the best of both worlds by rendering text in a visual style that is easy and quick to read and understand what
is going on but without being more than text.

- you could have a room be a small paragraph of floating text which you can navigate perhaps like a first person 3D game where you can
  turn and walk and run.  Around it would be text representing the exits by name and walking towards them (possibly clicking on them or
  pressing a key (like enter) while standing in range of one would transport you to the next room.  People could be around represented
  by moving text.
- There could be various colours, fonts, and perhaps even advanced styles (like a forest having the description in 3D font that resembles
  trees) each representing the mood or whatever.
- when monsters attack, you would see the attack description in red italics appear and then move diagonally like a slashing motion or
  something, and the counter attack text moving up towards the monster in like bright blue or some kind of power colour


- with any text based mud, visual style should be a major part.  Effective use of capitals and lowercase, colour, bold/italics, font type
  if available, use of spaces and justification, space between letters, space between lines, even unevenness of the characters, being on
  an angle, spelt backwards, with contrasting backgrounds
- could you use a CSS based system?  Could you even make this browser based somehow??

- you could do this in a simpler system with just a text console and ncurses
