This document describes the core actions on objects, what they do, and the actions on other objects they
call in order to get done what needs to get done.


THING(3) --- CONTAINER(4) --- ROOM(10)

  +--- EXIT(11)

container:addobj(obj, exit)
	obj.location:can_leave(obj) -> to make sure the object can leave it's location
	room:can_enter(obj) -> to make sure the object can enter this room
	obj.location:do_leave(obj, exit) -> to print a message about the object's departure
	- add the object to the room
	container:do_enter(obj, exit) -> to print a message about the object's arrival

room:<north|south|east|west|...>()
	- finds the appropriately named exit
	exit:go(caller) -> to do the actual move

exit:go(mobile)
	- checks that the exit is usable by the mobile
	exit.target:addobj(mobile, exit) -> to do the actual move

user:teleport(room)
	room:addobj(user, nil) -> to move the user with checks

user:get(obj, container)
	- find the object in the container
	user:addobj(obj, nil) -> to move the object to the user's inventory with checks

user:drop(obj)
	user.location:addobj(obj, nil) -> to move the object to the room with checks

user:put(obj, container)
	container:addobj(obj, nil) -> to move the object to the container with checks

user:give(obj, mobile)
	mobile:addobj(obj, nil)


room:can_enter(obj)
	- check that the room is not locked
	- if the thing is an object, make sure you can drop stuff here

room:can_leave(obj)
	(nothing so far)

room:do_enter(obj, exit)
	- if the thing is a mobile, print a message about it arriving
	- if the thing is an item, print a message about the caller dropping it
	room:look() -> if it's a mobile

room:do_leave(obj, exit)
	- if the thing is a mobile, print a message about it leaving
	- if the thing is an item, print a message about the caller picking it up

(are there can_enter/can_leave, do_enter/do_leave functions for containers?)


room:look(obj)
	if !obj then obj = room
	obj:look_self() -> to print the actual look message

thing:look_self()
	- print the room name
	- print the description
	thing:tell_contents() -> to list the contents of the object

room:tell_contents()
	- print a brief list of exits
	- print a list of objects in the room

room:exits()
	- print exits and their names

room:say(text)
	- check that the room isn't silent
	caller:notify(formatted text) -> to print to the user
	room:announce(formatted text) -> to print to all the users in the room

room:announce(text)
	- foreach object in the room do....
	user:notify(text) -> to print to the user

user:notify(text)
	- send the text to the user
