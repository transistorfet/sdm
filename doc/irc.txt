- User connects and if the nick is registered, he must log in somehow (nickserv or possibly via PASS before connecting) or else
  he cannot use that account.  If the nick is not a registered user, then a temp user is created which is not saved to disk and
  which has limited functionality

- All users join #realm as their main window to the world??
- Perhaps a special user "Realm" or "TheRealm" will say things to you, like the status and stuff
- the topic should be a semi-brief description of the current room

- should moving from room to room force-change the channel (perhaps each channel name is #<thingid>) or should it be
  in the same channel, in which case all the users from the old room will PART and the people in the new room JOIN
  which might seem pretty strange.  The alternative is to make it a session between you and TheRealm in which case you
  wont see the people in the current room in the user's list and it will seem a little clunky perhaps, everything being said
  by TheRealm, however the actual text that is printed could be the same whether it's printed on telnet or IRC.
  (eg. the output function would in both cases receive "soandso says THIS" and both would print it as such so that
  telnet would just say "soandso says THIS" and IRC would say "[timestamp] <TheRealm> soandso says THIS"
