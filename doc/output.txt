- Output sent to a user will include at least one MooThing
- Output is sent without some of the qualifying stuff parsed in and it will be the resposnibility of the interface/task to add it
  such as when someone says something, the output function gets "THIS", telnet will print "User says THIS" and irc will send
  :user PRIVMSG #realm :THIS or whatever


OUTPUT EXAMPLES:
- another player says something: player-thing, [room-thing] "THIS"
- the output of look: room-thing "description"
- the output of examine: object-thing "description"
- player says something in channel: player-thing, channel-thing "THIS"




HOW WILL THE FOLLOWING WORK:
- /whois should return some descriptions and stuff, possibly even evaling 'examine me' and returning results but
  when you type 'examine me', it should output it as normal.  How do you distinguish this?

- should output go directly to the user all the time or should it (maybe sometimes, dependant on function) be returned
  by a function (by an action i mean) for the calling function to print?  Or should it be redirectable in some way on
  a temporary basis?
