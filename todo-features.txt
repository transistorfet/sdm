GAME FEATURES TODO:
	* drunkenness (and high? and various other effects?)
	* ability to ride horses/mounts
	* fatigue, sleep/rest/stand/sit/wake/etc
	* ability to silence a character (for a spell)
	* lighting levels (rooms that are dark)
	* torches, light sources
	* have stores for buying and selling
	* have days/nights and time
	* mobiles (players) who can fly (like pixies)

	* make it possible for players to sell their own items from stores (they can make an object and sell it)
	* have pegboards everywhere (like at area/world markers) so that people can leave comments (thus enriching the social
	* space without there necessarily being people online at the same time in the same area.
	* you could have certain things be random encounter type stuff, like vampires that might infect you, or strange random
	* deaths that you can encounter.
	* vampire (by random) such that if you are one, you can't go outside (room marked outdoors) while it's daytime
	* you could have a channel where you control your own little pets or sims (maybe kinda like the sims)
	* make *liberal* use of colours and highlighting in the actual text.  Highlight key words so that they stand out, making
	  it *very* easy to skim the description, or see important alerts.  Make use of coloured backgrounds (fire text, and various
	  effects.  Perhaps you could make a whole library for encoding text colour patterns).
	* have 'emotion/feel/atmosphere' messages printed at random, to set the scene and make people aware of where they are.  It helps
	  with the emersion, which offsets the fact that it's all just text.  Messages could be printed more frequently and in brighter
	  colours when they are important, like when in impednding danger, or slow with soft colours, like describing a tranquil scene.
	  "A wisp of mist floats in the distance", "You hear the distance call of the loon."
	* real time stuff should be on the slowish side perhaps (or perhaps even settable by the user, a user selected difficulty
	  level!  With reduced XP for the easy difficulty.
	* have multiroom boss fights, monsters that occupy multiple rooms and that you have to fight through the rooms (like fight the
	  head to get to the room with the body where you can fight to eventually kill it)
	* have monster growth and evolution.  New monsters can be created with a low level and in a small form and over time they
	  grow to become large monsters that take a lot more effort to kill.  This is instead of having areas just automagically
	  regenerate once a player or group has been through and killed everything
	* you could have simulated people in towns that might move, marry, die, build houses, etc.  It would give people some
	  incentive to play even when there are no other humans playing

	* there *MUST* be an automatic map system so you can easily find out where you are (like the complete world name/realm/etc
	  and an ASCII map of the rooms in the nearby area (but then we'd have to keep track of if the user has visited.  Alternatively,
	  we could do a map or just compass directions list of the major landmarks in the distance.  Like "Towards the east is the town
	  of somethings" "Towards the southwest are the mountains of garakch"
